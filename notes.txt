Q1.api qustion:-(1101)
    1. we need to use type module in script.
    2. we can use then and catch for the promises.
    3.using invoke function

Q2. how to execute function as a String:(1153)
=> 1. using new Function we can execute the function
      const fn = new Function(res + "; fatchData();")
=>how it will work ?
    step1:- new Function create function at the runtime which is anonymous function.
    step2:- The string is treated as the function body
    step3:-fatchData() acts an function which is wrape inside the anonymous function and it will return function.
    step4:-when we call function then our function should be called

=> 2. using eval():-(1165)
      eval() used for execute string of javaScript at run time.
      
      used for dynamic evaluation of function expression or code.

=>notes:
-console.log([]) it will return blank string

-type="module" is a modern JavaScript feature introduced with ES6 that enables modular, scoped, and advanced JavaScript development.

-type="module" tells to browser to enable ES6 features like enabling scoped variables, strict mode, async features like top-level await

-it's enable top-level await

-Top-level await means using await outside of an async function, which is allowed only in ES modules.

-When a JavaScript file is a module, you are allowed to use await directly at the top of the file, without wrapping it inside an async function.

-new Function() creates a new function at runtime

-javascript object never compared

-All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

-Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.

-In Array,Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array

-new Array(40) creates an array with length 40 and empty slots, not a value.

-new Array(40, 100) creates an array containing the values 40 and 100.

-Strict mode in JavaScript is a way to run your code under stricter rules to help you write safer, cleaner, and less error-prone code.

-The arguments object is a local variable that contains the arguments passed to the function when called. 

-in arrow function it will gives an error.That's because the arguments variable does not exist in arrow functions.

-Objects are objects
-Maths are objects
-Functions are objects
-Dates are objects
-Arrays are objects
-Maps are objects
-Sets are objects

-   JSON.stringify() → object to string
    JSON.parse() → string to object

- promise example (761-808)

1.undefined:- it is a like plceholder which is kept inside the varible.
2.laxical environemt:
=>it is created when global execution created
=>it is local memory along with it's (+) laxical environment of it's parent.
=>it is also known as scope chain.
3.scope:
=>it is specify the limit of the varible where we can access them.
4.varibles:
=>let and const varibles are hoisted.
=>let and const both are block scope variables.
    I.let: redeclaration not allowed.reInistialize allowed.
    II.const: both are not allowed
    III.var: both are allowed

5.Web Apis :- following all the features are not part of JS.it is a part of web browser
=>setTimeOut()
=>Dom Api
=>fetch()
=>localstorage
=>console
=>location

6.microtaskQueue:it is similar to callback queue but it has higher priority as compare to callBackQueue.
=>all the call back function which is comes through promises it will move to the microTaskQueue.

7.call/apply/bind method:(414)

=>call:- it is used when we want to access the method of 1st object in 2nd object.
Calls the function immediately and passes arguments one by one

=>apply:-Calls the function immediately and passes arguments as an array

=>bind:-Does NOT call immediately — returns a new function

    V.slice(start, end):-

    VI.substr():-it is similar to slice().
    The difference is:
    => the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.
    => can't support nagative index.
    => support nagative index

    VII.trim():-The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string.

    VIII.padStart():-The padStart() method pads a string from the start. (430)

    IX.padEnd():-The padEnd() method pads a string from the end. (430)

    X.replace():-The replace() method does not change the string it is called on.The replace() method returns a new string.The replace() method replaces only the first match

    XI.replaceAll():-The replaceAll() method replaces all the match

=>for convert String to Array:-

    split():-A string can be converted to an array with the split() method (439)

=>for String Search:-

    I.indexOf():-The indexOf() method returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a string in a string, or it returns -1 if the string is not found. (446)

    II.lastIndexOf():-The lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string,or it returns -1 if the string is not found. (446)

    III.match():-The match() method returns an array containing the results of matching a string against a string (or a regular expression).

    IV.matchAll():-The matchAll() method returns an iterator containing the results of matching a string against a string (or a regular expression).(452)

    V.include():-The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified value.Otherwise it returns false.

    =>text.includes("world", 12) Check if a string includes "world". Start at position 12

    VI.startsWith():-The startsWith() method returns true if a string begins with a specified value.Otherwise it returns false

    =>text.startsWith("world", 5):-A start position for the search can be specified if world start at position 5 then it will return true otherwise return false.

    VII.endsWith():-The endsWith() method returns true if a string ends with a specified value.Otherwise it returns false.

    =>text.endsWith("world", 5):-A End position for the search can be specified if world End at position 5 then it will return true otherwise return false.


9.Array Methods:-

    II.push():-add element add the last index

    III.pop():-remove last element from the last index

    IV.at():-The at() method returns an indexed element from an array.

    V.join():-The join() method also joins all array elements into a string.It behaves just like toString(), but in addition you can specify the separator (471)

    VI.shift():-The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

    VII.unshift():-The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements:

    VIII.concat():-The concat() method creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays. (476)
    =>The concat() method does not change the existing arrays. It always returns a new array. (476)

=>Flattening an Array:-Flattening is useful when you want to convert a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array.

    I.flate():-it is used to create new array single dimensional array from multi dimensional array.and remove nesting of array (493)

    II.flateMap():- flatMap having a call back function where we can modify the elements of an array (499)

=>Splicing and Slicing Arrays

    I.splice():- The splice() method add/remove items to an array. (511)
    =>The first parameter defines the position where Perfom The Action.
    =>The second parameter defines how many elements should be removed.
    =>The rest of the parameters ("Lemon" , "Kiwi") define the new elements to be added.

    II.toSpliced():- The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

    III.slice():-The slice() method slices out a piece of an array into a new array. (517)
    =>The slice() method creates a new array.
    =>The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.
    =>The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3).
    =>The method then selects elements from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument.

=>Array Search

    I.indexOf():-The indexOf() method searches an array for an element value and returns its position.

    => returns -1 if the item is not found.

    II.lastIndexOf():-Array.lastIndexOf() is the same as Array.indexOf(), but returns the position of the last occurrence of the specified element.

    III.includes():-This allows us to check if an element is present in an array or not

    IV.find():-The find() method returns the value of the first array element that passes a test function.and find() have a callBack function (532)

    V.findIndex():-The findIndex() method returns the index of the first array element.

    VI.findLast():-the findLast() method that will start from the end of an array and return the value of the first element that satisfies a condition.

    VII.findLastIndex():-The findLastIndex() method finds the index of the last element that satisfies a condition.

=> Array Sort:

    I.sort():-The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically and creates a new array.
    =>and in number if value is possitive then swap and if nagative then no swap (544)

    II.reverse():-The reverse() method reverses the elements in an array:

    III.toSorted():-The difference between toSorted() and sort() is that the sort() method can't create new array it will alter the elements of an array, while the toSorted() method creates a new array keeping the orignal array unchanged.


=> Array Iteration:

    I.map() 

    II.filter() 

    III.reduce():-The reduce() method runs a function on each array element to produce a single value. (552)

    IV.reduceRight():-reduceRight() works exactly like reduce(), but it processes the array from right to left.
    =>Starts from the last element
    =>Moves toward the first element
    =>Combines all values into one single result

    V.every():-The every() method checks if all array values pass a test. (558)

    VI.some():-The some() method checks if some array values pass a test.

    =>JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:
        Global scope
        Function scope
        Block scope

15.control flow:-Control Flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program.
=>By default, JavaScript runs code from top to bottom and left to right.  
=>Jump Statements: 
    I. break - exits a loop or switch
    II. continue - skips the current loop iteration
    III. return - exits from a function
    IV. throw - jumps to error handling

16.sets:-

=>Each value can only occur once in a Set.
=>The values can be of any type, primitive values or objects.


=>sets method are following:
    I. union()

    II.intersection()

    III.difference():-return the element whose included in A but not in B.

    IV.symmetricDifference():- return all the unique elements from the both sets.

    V. isSubsetOf():-check what if all the elements of A is present in B or not and gives Boolean value true or false.

    VI.isDisjointFrom():-it will return true if elements of A is not present in B.it means B set contains unique element.

    VII. has():-The has() method returns true if a specified value exists in a set.(1360)

    VIII.values()/keys():-(1364)
    =>The values() and keys() are same in sets it will returns an Iterator object with the values in a Set.

    IX.entries():-(1364)
    =>it will return and Iterator which contains [value value]

=>WeakSet():-
-A JavaScript WeakSet is a collection of values where the values must be objects.
-You cannot iterate over the values with for loops, forEach(), or values().
-You cannot access the size. WeakSets have no size property.

=>Methods:-
    I. new WeakSet():- Creates a new WeakSet object
    II. add(obj):-	Adds an Object to a WeakSet
    III. delete(obj):- Removes a WeakSet object
    IV. has(obj) :- Returns true if an object exists in a WeakSet

18.Map:-A JavaScript Map is an object that can store collections of key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in other programming languages.

=> Map Characteristics:


19.eval():- executes a string of JavaScript code at runtime.
=> used for dynamic evaluation of expressions, code, or functions

20. localstorage/sessionStorage/cookies:-
    =>localStorage → remember forever
    =>sessionStorage → remember until tab closes
    =>cookies → remember + send to server

=>Garbage Collection:-JavaScript employs a memory management mechanism known as Garbage Collection.
