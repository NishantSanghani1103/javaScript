Q1.api qustion:-(1101)
    1. we need to use type module in script.
    2. we can use then and catch for the promises.
    3.using invoke function

Q2. how to execute function as a String:(1153)
=> 1. using new Function we can execute the function
      const fn = new Function(res + "; fatchData();")
=>how it will work ?
    step1:- new Function create function at the runtime which is anonymous function.
    step2:- The string is treated as the function body
    step3:-fatchData() acts an function which is wrape inside the anonymous function and it will return function.
    step4:-when we call function then our function should be called

=> 2. using eval():-(1165)
      eval() used for execute string of javaScript at run time.
      
      used for dynamic evaluation of function expression or code.

=>notes:

-console.log([]) it will return blank string

-type="module" is a modern JavaScript feature introduced with ES6 that enables modular, scoped, and advanced JavaScript development.

-type="module" tells to browser to enable ES6 features like enabling scoped variables, strict mode, async features like top-level await

-it's enable top-level await

-Top-level await means using await outside of an async function, which is allowed only in ES modules.

-When a JavaScript file is a module, you are allowed to use await directly at the top of the file, without wrapping it inside an async function.

-new Function() creates a new function at runtime

-javascript object never compared

-All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string.

-Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.

-In Array,Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array

-new Array(40) creates an array with length 40 and empty slots, not a value.

-new Array(40, 100) creates an array containing the values 40 and 100.

-Strict mode in JavaScript is a way to run your code under stricter rules to help you write safer, cleaner, and less error-prone code.

-The arguments object is a local variable that contains the arguments passed to the function when called. 

-in arrow function it will gives an error.That's because the arguments variable does not exist in arrow functions.


-Objects are objects
-Maths are objects
-Functions are objects
-Dates are objects
-Arrays are objects
-Maps are objects
-Sets are objects

-   JSON.stringify() → object to string
    JSON.parse() → string to object

- Everything Without a "Value" is False

    0 is false

    "" is false

    undefined is false

    null is false

    NaN is false

    false is false

- promise example (761-808)

-Date Formula:
=> 1000 Ms=1 Minute
const minute = 1000 * 60;
const hour = minute * 60;
const day = hour * 24;
const year = day * 365;
let years = Math.round(Date.now() / year)

-Garbage collection = JavaScript automatically cleans up memory you’re no longer using.
=>You don’t manually free memory in JS.

=> Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
    const x = person;

- If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person.
- The object x is not a copy of person. The object x is person
- The object x and the object person share the same memory address.
- Any changes to x will also change person

=> A falsy value is a value that becomes false when JavaScript tries to convert it to a boolean.

=>  Primitives are copied by value
    Objects are copied by reference

=> If I change an object then it will affect the original object.
=> If I change a nested object property, it will affect the original object.

=>Jump Statements: 
    I. break - exits a loop or switch
    II. continue - skips the current loop iteration
    III. return - exits from a function
    IV. throw - jumps to error handling

16.sets:-

I.   ISO Date :	"2015-03-25" (The International Standard)
II.  Short Date:"03/25/2015"
III. Long Date: "Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015"

=> Date.parse() :-
-returns the number of milliseconds between the date and January 1, 1970.
